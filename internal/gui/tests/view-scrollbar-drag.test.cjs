// A page's own scrollbar is dragged by the mouse (emo172, #1089): Chromium and
// WebView2 give a scrollbar drag no pointermove of the reader's, so the "where
// the reader is" rule put each of its scrolls back as it came and the bar would
// not move — the wheel worked, only the drag did not. The same holds after a
// click in the page: what was clicked is held in place for a few seconds, and a
// hold that is not let go of fights the drag frame by frame. A scroll the reader
// never asked for (code setting scrollTop) is still put back: only the bar's own
// drag counts as the reader's, not every scroll.
// The app's own scrollbar CSS is what the pages draw with, so nothing here
// injects one: a scrollbar-width set on the view makes Chromium drop every
// ::-webkit-scrollbar rule (app.css) and draw Windows' classic bar instead.
// English and Chinese, Chromium and WebKit.

// the Routing page at a wide window lays its stage beside the list and has only
// ~35px left to scroll — not enough for a drag to be told from a nudge.
// The drag's last scroll arriving after the lift is checked on the list page
// only. It was left off Routing while #1249 was open — WebKit clamped Routing's
// last stretch, so a scroll sent there after the lift measured that bug rather
// than the window held open past it. #1249 is fixed in main now, so this could
// be widened to Routing; it is not, because that clamp was only ever checked on
// Windows headless WebKit here, not on the macOS WKWebView the maintainer runs,
// and widening a check is beyond what review asked for.
// `click` waits for the page to be drawn; `hold` is what the click in it lands
// on, and must leave the page as it is — the Routing page's own header opens
// the group editor in English, growing the page and scrolling it on its own.
